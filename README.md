# TRULYSCARED - Visual Essay On Society
trulyscared
I’m truly scared by the society. There is nothing more terrifying for me than a hive full of angry bees. Directed patterns of behaviour defined by the profession each of those creatures posesseses. Structures of their living environment so perfect yet so vulnerable if they were to be suddenly invaded. I like to think of those structures as of a soft core surrounded by a protective barrier. The truth is I have never studied bees. Neither society. But that’s just common sense.

My thoughts are always fragmentary. Only as they progress through time they become more than pieces of a puzzle, they become connections, the ultimate networking leading to this final release of creativity. Hypocrisy at its best, right?

Phone call conversation. 3 AM.

It is my mind, supposedly functioning within my brain, that tells me that I feel, smell and taste. It is my mind that interprets the signals received from my eyes and ears and turns them into image and sound. Wait, hold on. What do you mean by all that? Are you suggesting that feeling my own heartbeat is a suggestion of the mind and not an actual feeling? Yes. Our physical self and world around us is an impression of the mind. Everything we experience in all senses comes from the mind. But we are biological entities! We understand that we are complex beings. Nerve systems are running throughout our whole bodies. We feel because we know that it is the nervous system that sends signals to the brain giving us an impression of touching something, isn't that right? This is what you believe in rather than know for sure so let me ask you couple of questions. How can you be sure that there is anything out there? Are you sure that the signals come from the surroundings and not from the mind itself? World around us is not mind-independent. Mind informs us of something that supposedly is there. That seems a bit idealist to me. Let me continue: is it a constant state of dream we conjure all together? A dream that perhaps went wrong? Are we connected in some sort of a mind network that lets us coexist on the level of the mind, sharing similar but still slightly different versions of images, sounds, tastes and feelings? It is my opinion that we don't exist beyond our mind, which makes it impossible to determine whether the world around us is in fact real or not. Don't you dodge my questions with a conclusion... Beep... Beep... Beep...
